## Further Reading (For Developers)

### üîπ Core Concepts

* **Chapters** are defined by a JSON file containing:

  * Metadata (`id`, `title`, `author`, `description`, `tags`, `rating`, etc.)
  * Volumes ‚Üí Chapters ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Panels
  * Each **Page** has an image and panel definitions.
  * Each **Panel** can define:

    * `coordinates` ‚Üí polygonal region of the panel
    * `center` ‚Üí focus point for camera zoom
    * `events` ‚Üí background music (BGM), sound effects (SFX), and text-to-speech/narration (TTS)

* **Assets** (images, audio) are preloaded in a `PreloaderScene`.

---

### üéÆ Navigation Behavior

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Forward (Next Panel)

When moving **forward** into a new panel:

**1. Camera Transition** - Smooth pan & zoom into the panel‚Äôs `center` and fit its polygon area.

**2. Audio Handling**

* **BGM**: Replaces previous background music unless it‚Äôs the same track.
* **SFX**: New sound effects trigger with optional looping and fade-in.
* **TTS**: Narration/voice line plays with optional delays and fade-in.

**3. Overlay Reveal** - Black overlay fades out for a cinematic reveal.

#### ‚óÄÔ∏è Backward (Previous Panel)

When moving **backward** into an earlier panel:

1. Camera pans & zooms back to the previous `center`.
2. Previous **BGM**, **SFX**, and **TTS** are restored.
3. Overlay fade animation ensures smooth navigation.

#### üîÑ Panel Revisit

* Same **BGM** across panels = continues seamlessly.
* **SFX/TTS** always restart on entry.
* Allows back-and-forth reading without breaking immersion.

---

### üì¶ Asset Loading & Caching

* Uses **Phaser Loader** with a `PreloaderScene`.
* Dynamically loads:

  * Page images
  * Audio tracks (BGM/SFX/TTS)
* Prevents duplicate loads with Phaser‚Äôs asset cache.
* Shows progress bar + text while loading.

---

### üé® Panel System

* **Panels are polygons** defined by coordinates.
* **Center point** = precomputed target for camera focus.
* **Events system** = binds BGM, SFX, and TTS to each panel.
* Designed for **non-rectangular manga panels**.
